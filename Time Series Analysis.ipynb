    "**General Idea**: There is a time/independent/response variable and a target variable. We try to understand the characteristics of the time variable with time and use this to predict/forecast the target variable at a point in time.\n",
    "A time series would be of the following types:\n",
    "1. Trend: The divergence would be continuous in nature. Can be positive/negative/null trend.Its either upward or downsward trend and hence it's easy to predict.\n",
    "2. Seasonality: Can be a bell curve or saw tooth. The pattern may be repeatable and hence its easy to predict.\n",
    "3. Cyclical: There is no fixed time interval and there can be uncertainity in the movement and its pattern. Hence, it is difficult to predict.\n",
    "4. Irregularity: This is similar to Cyclical, but even more erratic and unexpected than it. This is also difficult to predict."
